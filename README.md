# Simple_Linear_Regression-Marks_Prediction

## Objective: 
Implementing a Simple Linear Regression Project that predcicts the marks of the students based on the no. of hours they spend studying

## Dataset: 
Preprocessed and cleaned dataset obained from Kaggle.

## Visualization: 
Visualized the correlation between 'hours' and 'scores' using a scatter plot which turned out to have a sort of Linear Pattern

## Libraries Used:
- pandas & numpy : To  load dataset and for usage of dataframes and series datastructure
- Matplotlib & seaborn : For Visualization of data
- scikit-learn : To branch the dataset into training and testing set. Model Training & prediction by importing LinearRegression module & to measure regression metrics
- warnings : To ignore warnings pop up by jupyter lab

## Regression Metrics:
Used scikit-learn metrics library to study Regression metrics for my model.
- MAE [Mean Absolute Error]
- MSE [Mean Squared Error]
- RMSE [Root Mean Squared Error]
- R2 Score
- Adjusted R2 Square
